# Data Science - Internship Tasks Repository

This repository contains all the Data Science projects that I have completed during my internship program.

## Task 1: EDA and Visualization of a Real-World Dataset
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brendan45774/test-file).
- Dataset Loading → Used Pandas to load and inspect the dataset structure.
- Data Cleaning → Handled missing values (imputation/removal), removed duplicates, and identified outliers using statistical techniques.
- Visualizations → Bar Charts for categorical features,
  Histograms to analyze numeric feature distributions,
- Correlation Heatmap to examine relationships between numerical variables.
- s
## Task 2: Text Sentiment Analysis
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).
- Text Preprocessing → Tokenization, Stopword Removal, Lemmatization
- Feature Engineering → TF-IDF Vectorization
- Model Training → Logistic Regression
- Model Evaluation → Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

## Task 3: Fraud Detection System
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud).
- Data Preprocessing → Handled class imbalance using SMOTE
- Model Training → Trained Random Forest for fraud detection
- Model Evaluation → Measured Precision, Recall, F1-score
- Testing Interface → Created a CLI tool for real-time fraud checking

## Task 4: Predicting House Prices Using the Boston Housing Dataset
(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/schirmerchad/bostonhoustingmlnd).
- Data Preprocessing → Normalized features for regression.
- Implemented Regression Models from Scratch → Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost without sklearn.
- Model Evaluation → Compared using RMSE & R² Score.
- Feature Importance → Visualized most influential features.
